## 🌟 Overview / Introduction

Welcome to the **Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSC) at SUNY Farmingdale**!

Our mission at GDSC Farmingdale State College is to provide an invaluable opportunity for students to gain practical experience in building applications and services, develop their skills in software engineering, and explore new areas of technology. We believe this hands-on approach is crucial for preparing students for successful careers in the technology industry and empowering them to contribute to innovative solutions that positively impact society.

Google Developer Student Clubs (GDSCs) are community groups for students passionate about learning and practicing development skills. These clubs are designed to help students learn how to build real-world solutions using Google's technologies and platforms, as well as to provide a platform for students to connect, learn, and grow together in a supportive environment.

### 🎯 Purpose & Goals

*   **Educate:** Offer workshops, study jams, and learning sessions on various Google technologies and industry-relevant topics.
*   **Innovate:** Encourage students to work on practical projects, developing solutions to real-world problems.
*   **Connect:** Build a strong community where students can network with peers, mentors, and industry professionals.
*   **Empower:** Help students build their portfolios, enhance their resumes, and prepare for tech careers.

### ✨ Why It Matters / Problem It Solves

Many academic programs focus heavily on theoretical knowledge. GDSC Farmingdale bridges this gap by offering practical, hands-on experience, allowing students to apply classroom learning to real-world scenarios. We provide a space to experiment, fail fast, learn, and grow, which are critical skills often refined outside traditional coursework.

### 👤 Target Audience

Our club is primarily for **all SUNY Farmingdale students** interested in technology, regardless of their major, experience level, or background. Whether you're a beginner curious about coding, an experienced developer looking for collaborators, or simply want to learn about the tech industry, GDSC Farmingdale is for you!

### CLI Commands (for Project Work)

When working on collaborative projects hosted on GitHub, you'll commonly use these Git commands:

```bash
# 1. Clone a project repository
git clone https://github.com/GDSC-FSC/your-project-repo.git
cd your-project-repo

# 2. Create a new branch for your feature/fix
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature

# 3. Make changes, then stage and commit them
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add new user authentication flow"

# 4. Pull latest changes from the main branch before pushing (to avoid conflicts)
git pull origin main # or 'master' depending on repo config

# 5. Push your branch to GitHub
git push origin feature/my-new-feature

# 6. (After pushing) Open a Pull Request on GitHub
#    - Go to the repository on GitHub and follow the prompts.
```

### Code Samples (Workshop Example)

Here's a simplified example of a "Hello World" in Flutter, a common technology covered in GDSC workshops:

```dart
// main.dart - A simple Flutter application
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'GDSC Flutter Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        primarySwatch: Colors.blue,
      ),
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('Hello GDSC Farmingdale!'),
        ),
        body: const Center(
          child: Text(
            'Welcome to our Flutter workshop!',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: 24, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

To run this Flutter app:

```bash
# Assuming Flutter SDK is installed and configured
flutter create my_gdsc_app
cd my_gdsc_app
# Replace lib/main.dart with the code above
flutter run
```

### Common Use Cases

*   **Learning a New Skill:** Attend a themed workshop (e.g., "Intro to Machine Learning with TensorFlow").
*   **Building Your Portfolio:** Join a group project to create a web app for a local charity.

## ⚠️ Limitations, Known Issues & Future Roadmap

As a student-run organization, we operate with certain realities and are always striving to improve.

### Current Limitations

*   **Volunteer-Driven:** Our activities are powered by the dedication of student volunteers. This can sometimes lead to varying levels of availability or project timelines.
*   **Resource Constraints:** Access to specialized equipment, software licenses, or funding might be limited compared to professional organizations.
*   **Time Commitment:** Balancing academic responsibilities with club activities can be challenging for core members and participants.

### Known Issues

*   **Scheduling Conflicts:** Finding times that work for all students can be difficult due to diverse academic schedules. We try our best to offer flexible options.
*   **Technical Setup Challenges:** Sometimes students encounter issues setting up development environments. We provide support, but individual system configurations can vary widely.

### Planned Enhancements (Future Roadmap)

*   **Expand Workshop Offerings:** Introduce more advanced topics and niche technologies (e.g., Web3, game development).
*   **Initiate Larger-Scale Projects:** Tackle more ambitious, multi-semester projects with real-world impact.
*   **Strengthen Industry Partnerships:** Invite more guest speakers, organize tech talks, and explore internship opportunities with local companies.
*   **Mentorship Program:** Establish a formal mentorship program connecting experienced students with beginners.
*   **Inter-Club Collaborations:** Partner with other campus clubs or GDSCs from neighboring colleges for joint events.

*   **Share Your Ideas:** Participate in brainstorming sessions and provide feedback.

### Branch/PR Guidelines (for Code Contributions to Projects)

When contributing code to any of our GitHub repositories, please follow these guidelines:

1.  **Fork & Clone:** Fork the target repository, then clone your fork to your local machine.
2.  **Branching Strategy:** Create a new descriptive branch for each feature or bug fix:
    *   `feature/add-user-profile`
    *   `fix/bug-login-issue`
    *   `docs/update-readme`
3.  **Commit Messages:** Write clear, concise, and descriptive commit messages using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) (e.g., `feat: Implement user login endpoint`, `fix: Correct typo in header`).
4.  **Pull Requests (PRs):**
    *   Open PRs from your feature branch to the `main` (or `develop`) branch of the original repository.
    *   Provide a clear title and detailed description of your changes, including why they were made and any relevant issue numbers (e.g., `Closes #123`).
    *   Request reviews from project leads or core members.
    *   Address feedback promptly.
5.  **Stay Updated:** Regularly pull changes from the upstream `main` branch into your local branch to avoid merge conflicts.

### Code Style, Testing, Linting

While specific guidelines may vary per project, we generally advocate for:

*   **Consistent Code Style:** Follow established style guides (e.g., [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for JavaScript, [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for Python, [Dart Format](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/usage#formatting) for Flutter). Use formatters and linters.
*   **Testing:** Write unit and integration tests where appropriate to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
*   **Documentation:** Document your code, especially complex functions or components, and update project-level documentation as needed.

### Development Setup (General for Projects)

*   **Version Control:** Ensure Git is installed and configured.
*   **Dependencies:** Follow project-specific instructions for installing dependencies (e.g., `npm install`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `flutter pub get`).
*   **Environment Variables:** Set up any necessary environment variables for API keys, database connections, etc. (usually defined in a `.env` file and *not* committed to Git).
